# Sonos
This is the repo for the open-sourced Sonos plugin which is a Python 3 development of the Sonos plugin originally developed by Nick [@nlagaros on the Indigo forums].

A huge shoutout is due to Nick for originally providing this plugin and for supporting it for so many years!

This plugin is has now been released to the Indigo Plugin Store and has moved out of beta.

There are some outstanding issues: SiriusXM doesn't work and some player states aren't updating.
